A program for automatically handling the starting and stopping of cgMiner when the computer is idle.

-When computer is idle for x amount of time, start mining at full blast.
-When computer comes in use, shut off the miner completly. Kill the process so that use of the computer is restored
instantly. Previous attempts to "throttle down" the intensity to restore use of the computer have failed for unknown
reasons.
